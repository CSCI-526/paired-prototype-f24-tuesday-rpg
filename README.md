# TriangleGo

## Overview

**TriangleGo** is a 2D-platformer game where players must navigate through dangerous environments using WASD controls to dodge a barrage of projectiles. In this innovative game, the player can utilize nearby triangular objects to deflect incoming attacks. Along the way, players must also avoid obstacles and use the unique properties of the triangles to gain strategic advantages and power-ups.

The core mechanic of **TriangleGo** is to interact with triangles in the environment, allowing players to shield themselves from projectiles and earn special rewards based on how they use the geometry. With its dynamic approach to shape-based gameplay, **TriangleGo** offers an exciting twist to the traditional platforming genre.

## Gameplay Mechanics

In **TriangleGo**, the environment is filled with moving obstacles, fast-moving projectiles, and various triangular objects. The player must avoid incoming arrows by quickly moving out of the way or using nearby triangles to absorb the attacks. Each triangle has its unique properties that can provide defense or a temporary advantage.

Players will collect **EXP** as they traverse the levels, and once the energy bar is full, players can use it to **boost** their abilities, allowing them to move faster or gain temporary invincibility.

Obstacles appear on the road and must be carefully avoided. The player’s survival depends on quick reflexes, precise movement, and smart use of the environment.
